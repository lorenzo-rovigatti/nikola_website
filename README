The website builds well with Nikola v8.2.4.

```
pip3 install "nikola[extras]"
pip3 install myst-parser
pip3 install nanoid
pip3 install pybtex
sudo npm install -g less
```

This is the list of plugins used:

```
nikola plugin -i myst
nikola plugin -i publication_list
nikola plugin -i less
nikola theme -i bnw
```

**Nota Bene:** I have changed the way `publication_list` works: it now preprocesses the bibtex file to produce a unique id for each entry (to avoid repeated entries).
