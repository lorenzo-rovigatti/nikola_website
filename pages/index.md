# Biography

<img src="images/portrait.jpg" class="portrait"> I have received my Master's degree in Physics (2009) and PhD diploma in Materials Science (2012) from Sapienza University of Rome before holding post-doc positions in Rome, Vienna (as a List-Meitner fellow in the Computational Physics group of the University of Vienna), Oxford (as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellow in the Physics Department) and back in Rome at the Institute of Complex Systems at CNR. I then spent three years as a Rita-Levi Montalcini fellow in the Physics Department at Sapienza before becoming an Associate Professor. Throughout my career I have focused on the collective behaviour of colloidal systems, as investigated through a combination of theory and simulation, and on the thermodynamics of systems made of DNA.

# My research

My research revolves around soft condensed matter and self assembly. In particular, I am interested in the phase behaviour of systems composed by anisotropically interacting nano- and micro-sized particles as well as (bio)polymeric constructs. Head <a href="link://slug/my-main-research-topics">here</a> if you are curious.

For my research I use computer simulations and theoretical approaches devised for the investigation of complex fluids. All my codes are [open source](https://github.com/lorenzo-rovigatti) (even this [website](https://github.com/lorenzo-rovigatti/nikola_website)). Feel free to contact me (see the footer below&#8595;) if you have any questions!
