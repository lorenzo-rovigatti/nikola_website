# Computational Biophysics 

## A.A. 2024/2025

### Prof. Lorenzo Rovigatti (lorenzo.rovigatti@uniroma1.it)

---

# My research

* Soft matter (including biophysics)
* Self-assembly (colloids, proteins, nucleic acids)
* DNA nanotechnology
* Polymeric assemblies (star polymers, microgels)

# Schedule

* Monday 13-15, Aula 3
* Tuesday 12-14, Aula 7
* Thursday 16-18, Aula 8

Why six hours per week? I may have to put the course on hold for one-two weeks...

---

# Organisation

* The course will feature frontal lectures only
* There will be some hands-on lectures where I'll ask you to bring your own laptop
* Your grade will be based on
  * A final project (optional)
  * Homework assignments (optional)
  * An oral exam on the project and homeworks (if done), or on the lectures' content
* Office hours (= ricevimento): write to me and we will set up a meeting!

# Program

* Introduction to biophysics and Python programming
* Introduction to proteins
* Introduction to nucleic acids
* Folding, design and structure prediction of proteins and nucleic acids
* Notions of quantum molecular mechanics
* Molecular dynamics
* Coarse-grained models
* Enhanced sampling techniques

---

# Books &amp; papers

* A. L. Lehninger, *Principles of biochemistry*
  * A bible of biochemistry
* A.V. Finkelstein, O. Ptitsyn, *Protein physics: a course of lectures*
  * Protein physics in a nutshell
* T. Schlick, *Molecular modeling and simulations: an interdisciplinary guide*
  * Very useful as a crash course to DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as to the way the are modelled with a computer
* J. N. Israelachvili, *Intermolecular and surface forces*
  * An excellent (and comprehensive) book on intermolecular forces
* D. Frenkel, B. Smit, *Understanding molecular simulation: from algorithms to applications*
  * The bible of molecular simulations
