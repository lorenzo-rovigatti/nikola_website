# Computational Biophysics 

## A.A. 2024/2025

### Prof. Lorenzo Rovigatti (lorenzo.rovigatti@uniroma1.it)

---

# My research

* Soft matter (including biophysics)
* Self-assembly (colloids, proteins, nucleic acids)
* DNA nanotechnology
* Polymeric assemblies (star polymers, microgels)

# Schedule

* Monday 13-15, Aula 3
* Tuesday 12-14, Aula 7
* Thursday 16-18, Aula 8

Why six hours per week? I may have to put the course on hold for one-two weeks...

# Etiquette

* English? Italian? It depends on the audience...
* Ask questions and interrupt me if something is not clear!
* Feel free to pose questions either in English or Italian, don't be shy!

---

# Organisation

* The course will feature frontal lectures only
* There will be some hands-on lectures where I'll ask you to bring your own laptop
* Office hours (= ricevimento): write to me and we will set up a meeting!
* Your grade will be based on
  * A final project (optional)
  * Homework assignments (optional)
  * An oral exam on the project and homeworks (if done), or on the lectures' content

---

# Homeworks?

* I will present codes that implement some of the algorithms discussed during lectures
* At the end of some sections I will present possible exercises that are related to the codes and methods presented.
* If you like a topic, you can try to tackle an exercise at home.
* If the task is carried out successfully, you will be assigned a grade and will be exempt from studying that topic for the oral exam.
* The final project can be chosen out of the possible extensions I foresaw for the homeworks, or you can suggest something yourself.

# Program

<div class="warning">
This program is preliminary as the course is going to be different from previous years. Let's see what we can do!
</div>

* Introduction to biophysics and Python programming
* Introduction to proteins
* Introduction to nucleic acids
* Folding, design and structure prediction of proteins and nucleic acids
* Notions of quantum molecular mechanics
* Molecular dynamics
* Coarse-grained models
* Enhanced sampling techniques

---

# Books &amp; papers

* A. L. Lehninger, *Principles of biochemistry*
  * A bible of biochemistry
* A.V. Finkelstein, O. Ptitsyn, *Protein physics: a course of lectures*
  * Protein physics in a nutshell
* T. Schlick, *Molecular modeling and simulations: an interdisciplinary guide*
  * Very useful as a crash course to DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as to the way the are modelled with a computer
* J. N. Israelachvili, *Intermolecular and surface forces*
  * An excellent (and comprehensive) book on intermolecular forces
* D. Frenkel, B. Smit, *Understanding molecular simulation: from algorithms to applications*
  * The bible of molecular simulations
  
<div class="focus">
I will suggest papers to read during the lectures. Check the <a href="https://lorenzo-rovigatti.github.io/comp_bio_notes/">notes</a> to find more references!
</div>

# Prerequisites

* Interest in biology/biochemistry (!)
* Willingness to (and possibly some experience with) writing and reading codes
* Working knowledge of thermodynamics and basic statistical mechanics
* Recommended: a laptop/computer with a working installation of Python and Jupyter

# My notes

I'm preparing a large *corpus* of notes ([link](https://lorenzo-rovigatti.github.io/comp_bio_notes)) that I want to use for the lectures. However, these are

1. Incomplete
2. Possibly full of typos and errors
3. Half-stolen, half-copied from books and papers

However, they also contain the codes and the homeworks I plan to assign. Use them responsably, and point out problems/issues.
