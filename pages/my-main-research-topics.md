This is a very incomplete list of my favourite research topics. Hopefully I'll write more about each topic in the future.

* Computational soft matter
* Self-assembly and self-assembly *vs.* phase separation
* Polymer and microgel systems
* <a href="link://slug/dna-based-materials">DNA-based materials<a/>
* Dipolar fluids

To get an idea of what I do, here is a word cloud generated by [Scholar Goggler](https://scholargoggler.com/), which takes into account the frequency of the words contained in the titles of the papers I published:
